# My Dev Portfolio
I Decided to make my portfolio Open source to show one of the ways I go about creating websites. Also wanted to help anyone looking for creative inspiration and access to the code. This projects uses a combination of React and Sass to keep it easy to update / replace components. Feel free to download and use it as is or change it to your liking. If you have any questions or spot a bug let me know either here on github or at hello@feilxmanuel.com.

# Features
* React since organizing site into components makes it easy to understand and change later on.
* Sass for readability and to speed up the time it takes to implement styles.
* Eslint to keep the code clean and styling consistent across project.
* Fully responsive
* Handful of subtle animations that can be used in other projects.
